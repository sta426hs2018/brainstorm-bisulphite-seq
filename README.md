## Summary of Bisulfite Sequencing

Bisulfite sequencing is used to analyze DNA methylation based on conversion of genomic DNA by using sodium bisulfite. 

Sodium bisulfite is able to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils. Methylated cytosines remian cytosins, however their methylation is lost in the process. The converted DNA is then analyzed for the amount of cytosines left. As they have not been converted, it can be assumed that those cytosines were methylated and therefore protected from the conversion.
